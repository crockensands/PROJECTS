Information File: Training an Agent in a 5x5 2D Custom Environment

Goal:
The goal of this simulation is to train an agent in a custom-built 5x5 grid 
environment to reach a target goal (state 24) using Q-learning. The environment 
has a simple grid layout, and the agent can take four possible actions: move up,
down, left, or right. The Q-learning algorithm is used to help the agent learn 
the optimal path to reach the goal, while minimizing exploration as the agent 
becomes more knowledgeable about the environment.
